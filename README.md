## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

There should be no necessary libraries to run the code here beyond the Anaconda distribution of Python.  The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

For this project, I was interested in using Titanic dataset to better understand:

1. Were Females more like to survive?
2. Were people of higher socioeconomic class more likely to survive?
3. Were people with more siblings or spouses aboard less likely to survive?

* `Titanic_Profile_Report.html` : Profiling report of train data set
* Data: Includes dataset provided by Kaggle for the competition
    * `train.csv` : Training data
    * `test.csv` : Testing data
* Visualizations: Includes all plots generated from the training data
